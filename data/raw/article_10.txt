=== Peripherals ===

Much like the original PlayStation, Sony released a series of peripherals to add extra layers of functionality. Such peripherals include memory cards, a DVD remote control, an internal or external hard disk drive (HDD), network adapter, horizontal and vertical stands, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player Multitap), a USB motion camera (EyeToy), keyboard and mouse, and a headset. Unlike the original PlayStation, which requires the use of an official PlayStation Mouse to play mouse-compatible games, the few PlayStation 2 games with mouse support also work with a standard USB mouse as well as a USB trackball.
Early versions of the console could be networked via an i.LINK port, though this had little game support and was ultimately removed in the "Slimline" model. Some third-party companies, such as Joytech, produced LCD monitor and speaker attachments for the PlayStation 2, which attach to the rear of the console. These allow users to play games without access to a television as long as there is access to mains electricity or a similar power source.
There are many accessories for musical games, such as dance pads for Dance Dance Revolution titles, Konami microphones for use with the Karaoke Revolution games, wireless microphones (sold with and used exclusively for SingStar games), various "guitar" controllers (for the Guitar Freaks series and Guitar Hero series), the drum set controller (sold in a box set (or by itself) with a "guitar" controller and a USB microphone (for use with Rock Band and Guitar Hero series), and a taiko drum controller for Taiko: Drum Master (2004).
Sony released a Linux-based operating system kit, Linux for PlayStation 2, which included a keyboard, mouse, Ethernet adapter and HDD. In Europe and Australia, the consoles comes with a free Yabasic interpreter on the bundled demo disc. This allows users to create simple programs for the PlayStation 2. A port of the NetBSD project and BlackRhino GNU/Linux, an alternative Debian-based distribution, are also available.
