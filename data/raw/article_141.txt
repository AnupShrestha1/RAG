=== Military events ===
Though the use of Fort Carré as a defensive installation spans more than three centuries, it was only attacked twice:

In 1591, during the wars of religion, Duke Charles-Emmanuel I of Savoy made a breakthrough in Provence and took the stronghold of Antibes without a fight. The French army launched by Henri IV to reconquer Provence laid siege to Antibes and its fort in 1592. The Duke of Épernon who led the siege retook the town and the fort. This is the only known military capture of Fort Carré;
In 1746 - 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession, the Fort Carré and Antibes were bombarded by Austro-Sardinian artillery and the English fleet, but the fort withstood the bombardment.
During the French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte was briefly imprisoned there. In July 1794, after the violent overthrow of Robespierre, General Bonaparte was detained as a Jacobin sympathizer and held in Fort Carré for ten days. His friend and political ally, Antoine Christophe Saliceti, secured his release.
In 1815, after Napoleon was definitively defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, the Fort Carré was occupied without a fight by Austro-Sardinian forces. The reason for this peaceful surrender of the Fort are not known. In any case, the Austro-Sardinians used their position in the Fort to bomb Antibes in order to get the Antibois to open the city gates. Antibes refused, despite significant damage to the city, and remained loyal to Louis XVIII. This experience shows that the Fort and the city of Antibes have to be defended as a unit — otherwise, the Fort could be used to attack the city.
