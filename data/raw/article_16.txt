The term gained prominence in the 2010s, and was declared by The Guardian in Britain to be the "defining insult of 2016", a term "thrown around with abandon in the wake of Brexit debate in the United Kingdom and the 2016 US election".
Common usages include the terms "special snowflake", "Generation Snowflake", "Snowflake Generation" and "snowflake" as a politicized insult. In the past, it held different meanings in reference to white people.


== Origins of the allegoric meaning ==
It is popularly believed that every snowflake has a unique structure. Most usages of "snowflake" make reference to the physical qualities of snowflakes, such as their unique structure or fragility, while a minority of usages make reference to the white color of snow.
