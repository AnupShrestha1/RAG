Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. Regarded as a pop icon, he is known for his three-octave tenor vocal range, live performances, retro showmanship and musical versatility. He is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans. Raised in Honolulu, Mars gained recognition in Hawaii as a child for his impersonation of Elvis Presley, before moving to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career.
Mars established his name in the music industry as a songwriter and co-founder of the production team the Smeezingtons. He rose to fame as a recording artist after featuring on the US number-one single "Nothin' on You" (2009) by B.o.B. Mars' first three studio albums – Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010), Unorthodox Jukebox (2012) and 24K Magic (2016) – found critical and commercial success, with the lattermost winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The albums spawned multiple international hit singles, including "Just the Way You Are", "Grenade", "The Lazy Song", "Locked Out of Heaven", "When I Was Your Man", "Treasure", "24K Magic", "That's What I Like" and "Finesse". He also featured on Mark Ronson's 2014 single "Uptown Funk", which became Billboard's best-performing song of the 2010s.
Mars' success continued throughout the 2020s. In 2021, he formed the musical superduo Silk Sonic with Anderson .Paak, and they released the 1970s R&B-inspired album An Evening with Silk Sonic, which contained the US number-one single "Leave the Door Open". Mars' 2024 chart-topping duets "Die with a Smile" with Lady Gaga and "Apt." with Rosé spent a total of 30 weeks atop the Billboard Global 200.
Mars has sold over 150 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He has scored nine Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. His 24K Magic World Tour (2017–2018) ranks among the highest-grossing tours in history.
