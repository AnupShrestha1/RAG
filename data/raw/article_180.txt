Owned by the SAS Group, it was organized as a business unit within Scandinavian Airlines, operating as a virtual airline using their crew and aircraft. Snowflake served a total 28 destinations from its bases at Stockholm Arlanda Airport and Copenhagen Airport.
The concept was launched using four Boeing 737-800 aircraft. It mainly served Mediterranean holiday destinations, as well as destinations popular with expatriates. From March 2004 two 737 aircraft were replaced with two McDonnell Douglas MD-82s. The airline underestimated its costs and achieved an insufficient load factor, thus making services unprofitable. After operations ended, SAS continued to use Snowflake as a brand for discounted tickets to European destinations.


== History ==
In 2003 SAS underwent a major restructuring program, which largely focused on reducing unit costs. As part of the program, the company's management, in cooperation with McKinsey & Company devised a scheme to better target the leisure market. The models of Ryanair and SAS' partner airline Lufthansa's low-cost subsidiary Germanwings were examined. SAS had just bought its main Norwegian competitor, Braathens, and had also significantly reduced Swedish domestic competition through the purchase of Linjeflyg. The airline was worried about new entrants in these markets, in particular about Ryanair and EasyJet.

The SAS Group announced plans for the airline on 10 December 2002, at the time giving it the provisional name Scandinavian Light.
