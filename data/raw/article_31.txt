Mars wore a pinky ring to celebrate the opening, created by Tiffany & Co. in yellow gold with the Pinky Ring initials framed in white diamonds on the front and "Pinky Ring 2024" on the back.
Mars' partnership with Fender on the "Bruno Mars Stratocaster", a limited-edition Fender Stratocaster in a color called "Mars Mocha Heirloom", was announced on November 7, 2023. The guitar, inspired by Mars's "retro style and showmanship", includes a "'69 neck profile modeled on Mars's own '69 Strat", "custom-voiced Fender Mars pickups" and "a leopard print strap, which pays homage to two of Mars's favorite guitar players, Jimi Hendrix and Prince". Mars said, "I don't think of myself as a guitar player. Every song is like a puzzle you have to solve, and a good guitar can bring something out of you that can help take you to the finish line."
Mars appeared in an August 2024 commercial for the Japanese discount-store chain Don Quijote. He, dancers Miyu, Haruka, Miyuri and miku, and store mascot Donpen danced around the Mega Don Quijote store in Shibuya while picking up articles from its People Brand (Jōnetsu kakaku). Mars wrote the jingle and shared the commercial on his Instagram. The collaboration included limited-edition goods released in September.
In September 2024, Mars (as Ricky Regal) partnered with Stetson to release a new "silhouette inspired by the American heritage brand's early designs". Available in different colours, it includes a "gold-toned horseshoe pin with rhinestones" and a "Stetson x Ricky Regal liner featuring a red rose". Mars designed the collection's hat. In December 2024, Mars and Hello Kitty collaborated to celebrate Hello Kitty's 50th anniversary and the opening of Mars' Park MGM residency. Limited-edition merchandise and themed food and drink was available at Park MGM's Hello Kitty Cafe, and a Hello Kitty meet-and-greet was held that month. On June 2025, Regal and Stetson released a new cowboy hat, the "Regal 10X Straw".
