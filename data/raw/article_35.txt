=== Re-entry into film ===
Following the failure of the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film, Nintendo was wary of creating films based on their franchises, though the Virtual Console service inspired them to pursue other utilizations of their popular software, including film. A partnership between Nintendo and Sony Pictures for an animated Mario film was leaked in 2014, though Nintendo announced in January 2018 that they would be partnering with Illumination to produce an animated Mario film, produced by Miyamoto and Chris Meledandri, and distributed by Universal Pictures. Titled The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the film was released on April 5, 2023, starring Chris Pratt as Mario. In 2021, Furukawa said Nintendo plans to explore animated adaptations of their franchises beyond The Super Mario Bros. Movie. In July 2022, the company announced its acquisition of the Japanese animation studio Dynamo Pictures, Inc., and renamed the studio to Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd. following the closure of the acquisition in October 2022.


== 2025—present: Nintendo Switch 2 ==
Shuntaro Furukawa claimed in February 2021 that the Nintendo Switch was "in the middle of its life cycle". Nintendo announced the console's successor, the Nintendo Switch 2, in January 2025. It retained the Switch's hybrid design. A Nintendo Direct about the new system happened in April. The new console launched in most regions on June 5, 2025.
