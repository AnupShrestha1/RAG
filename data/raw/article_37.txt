=== Venture into North America ===

Nintendo initially planned for the console to enter the North American market through a distribution agreement with Atari. The agreement was expected to be finalized at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in June 1983. However, during the show, Atari discovered that Coleco was demonstrating an unlicensed port of Nintendo's Donkey Kong on its Coleco Adam computer system. Atari, believing this violated its exclusive license for the game, delayed the deal. Shortly afterward, Atari CEO Ray Kassar was fired, the deal fell apart, and Nintendo decided to market its system on its own.: 283–286 
Nintendo thought the Famicom name might not resonate with American consumers, so they initially rebranded the system as the Advanced Video System (AVS). The AVS resembled a home computer rather than a "toy", featuring a built-in keyboard, a cassette-based data drive, and infrared wireless controllers.: 287  By positioning the console as a more "sophisticated" consumer electronics product, Nintendo aimed to distance themselves from the recent failures of companies such as Atari, Coleco, and Mattel. It was publicly demonstrated at the Winter CES in January 1985, but the reaction was lukewarm. While the hardware and games were praised, there was deep skepticism that the console could succeed in the United States, as the industry was still recovering from the video game crash of 1983. The March 1985 issue of Electronic Games magazine reported that the video game market in America "[had] virtually disappeared" and that "[it] could be a miscalculation on Nintendo's part".
With US retailers still wary of stocking game consoles after the 1983 crash, Yamauchi saw an opportunity to introduce the Famicom hardware to North America through arcades, launching it as the Nintendo VS. System in 1984.  The VS. System became a major success, selling nearly 100,000 cabinets and becoming the highest-grossing arcade machine of 1985 in the United States. This success gave Nintendo the confidence to pursue a home console launch and provided a platform to test new titles to help shape the launch line-up.

At the June 1985 Summer CES, Nintendo revealed its rebranded home console: the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).
