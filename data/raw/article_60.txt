=== Batteries ===
Batteries are an important component of diesel-electric submarines, propelling them and operating electric equipment underwater for long periods before having to surface to recharge the batteries. Improvements in battery technology in the 21st century have allowed smaller diesel-electric submarines to operate with greatly improved range and endurance. Lithium-ion battery technology was being planned for submarines by Japan in 2014. The Collins-class replacement may have operated battery technology superior to that of the existing Collins class.
The Australian Government's announcement on 20 February 2015 that the future submarines would have a similar range and endurance to the Collins class increased the likelihood that an evolved MOTS or completely new design would be selected.


=== Weapons capabilities ===
The 2009 defence white paper identified a land strike capability as an important addition to torpedo, mine and anti-ship missile weapons. In February 2015 the Australian Government identified its preference for the future submarines to have a US weapon system and heavyweight torpedo.
