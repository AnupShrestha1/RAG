=== Red Line Models ===

The Red Line trim vehicles were built from the same architecture as existing models, but with an emphasis heightened performance. Three models were given Red Line variants, those being (in chronological order) the Saturn ION Red Line, The Saturn Vue Red Line, and the Saturn Sky Red Line. The ION and Sky's Red Line trims were badge-engineered variants on other GM divisions' higher-tier performance vehicles, those being the ION Red Line's sister car of the Chevrolet Cobalt SS Supercharged and the Sky Red Line's sister car of the Pontiac Solstice GXP (although the targa hardtop variant would not make it to the Sky). The Vue Red Line, however, was an original Saturn vehicle until 2008, where it was then launched in a second generation as a badge-engineered Opel Antara.

Both the ION and Sky Red Line trims used 2.0L Ecotec family powertrains. The ION Red Line and Sky Red Line featured forced-induction Ecotec I4 motors. The ION Red Line utilized a 2.0L LSJ engine equipped with an Eaton M62 roots-type supercharger. The Sky Red Line featured the 2.0L LNF engine equipped with a twin-scroll turbocharger. On the other hand, the Vue Red Line featured first a naturally aspirated 3.5L Honda J35A3 V6 from the years 2004 to 2007. After 2007, the Vue was given a second generation, which featured GM's 3.6L naturally aspirated LY7 V6 also used in the Vue XR. This change in engine also came with an additional 7 horsepower (6 kW; 8PS) and 6 lb⋅ft (8 N⋅m) from the first generation Red Line models.
