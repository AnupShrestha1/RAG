=== 21st century: Olympic and Paralympic Games, removal of traffic ===

The square continues to be the location for the focal point of the Bastille Day military parade down the Champs-Élysées, with the President of France and invited guests watching the parade from the square.
In 2024, the square was the venue for 4 sports at the 2024 Summer Olympics (BMX freestyle, Breaking, Skateboarding and Basketball 3x3), as well as the venue for the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. Temporary stands and sporting facilities were built, while protecting items such as the Luxor Obelisk. Over 25,000 people attended the square each day during the Olympics, and the Paralympics opening ceremony was watched by 35,000 people in the square.
Following the Games, vehicle traffic did not return to the majority of the square, after Anne Hidalgo, the Mayor of Paris announced a partial pedestrianisation of the square in January 2024, with plans for a substantial redesign of the square in future.
