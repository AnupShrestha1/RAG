== History ==
Development of the PlayStation 3 began on March 9, 2001, when Sony Computer Entertainment president Ken Kutaragi announced a partnership with Toshiba and IBM  to develop the Cell microprocessor.  Around the same time, Shuhei Yoshida led a team focused on exploring next-generation game development. By early 2005, Sony shifted its focus toward preparing PS3 launch titles.
In September 2004, Sony confirmed that the PlayStation 3 would use Blu-ray as its primary media format, with support for DVDs and CDs. Nvidia was announced as the partner for the console's graphics processing unit in December 2004. The PS3 was officially unveiled on May 16, 2005, at E3, alongside a prototype of the Sixaxiscontroller featuring a boomerang-shaped design. No working hardware was present at E3 or at the Tokyo Game Show in September, though demonstrations such as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots were shown running on software development kits and comparable PC hardware. Sony also showcased concept footage based on projected system specifications, including a Final Fantasy VII tech demo.

The 2005 prototype included two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports, but by E3 2006, these had been reduced to one HDMI, one Ethernet, and four USB ports to cut costs. Sony also announced two launch models: a 60 GB version at US$599.99 / ¥60,000 / €599.99 and a 20 GB version at US$499.99 / ¥49,980 / €499.99. To further reduce costs, the 60 GB model was to be the only configuration to feature HDMI output, Wi-Fi, flash card readers and chrome trim. It was scheduled to launch on November 11, 2006 in Japan and November 17, 2006 in North America and Europe. 
On September 6, 2006, Sony delayed the PAL region launch to March 2007 due to a shortage of Blu-ray drive components, and announced it would not sell the 20 GB model in the region.
