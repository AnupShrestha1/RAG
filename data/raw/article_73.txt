=== Legacy ===
The Museum of Flight in Seattle parks a British Airways Concorde a few blocks from the building where the original 2707 mockup was housed in Seattle. While the Soviet Tu-144 had a short service life, Concorde was successful enough to fly as a small luxury fleet from 1976 until 2003, with British Airways lifetime costs of £1bn producing £1.75bn in revenues in the niche transatlantic market. As the most advanced supersonic transports became some of the oldest airframes in the fleet, profits eventually fell, due to rising maintenance costs.
The final-configuration Boeing 2707 mockup was sold to a museum and displayed at the SST Aviation Exhibit Center in Kissimmee, Florida, from 1973 to 1981. In 1983, the building, complete with SST, was purchased by the Faith World church. For years the Osceola New Life Assembly of God held services there with the airplane still standing above. In 1990, the mock-up was sold to aircraft restorer Charles Bell, who moved it, in pieces, to Merritt Island, in order to preserve it while it waited for a new home as the church now wanted the space for expansion. The forward fuselage was on display at the Hiller Aviation Museum of San Carlos, California, for many years, but in early 2013, was moved back to Seattle, where it is undergoing restoration at the Museum of Flight.
Seattle's National Basketball Association (NBA) basketball team, formed in 1967, was named the Seattle SuperSonics (shortened to "Sonics").  The name was inspired by the newly won SST contract.
