Five main rail lines were cut in London and rolling stock damaged.
Loge continued during October. 8200 tons (8,330 t) of bombs were dropped that month, about 10 percent in daylight, over 5400 tons (5,490 t) on London during the night. Birmingham and Coventry were subject to 450 long tons (457 t) of bombs between them in the last 10 days of October. Liverpool suffered 180 long tons (183 t) of bombs dropped. Hull and Glasgow were attacked but 715 long tons (726 t) of bombs were spread out all over Britain. The Metropolitan-Vickers works in Manchester was hit by 12 long tons (12.2 t) of bombs. Little tonnage was dropped on Fighter Command airfields; Bomber Command airfields were hit instead.
Luftwaffe policy at this point was primarily to continue progressive attacks on London, chiefly by night attack; second, to interfere with production in the vast industrial arms factories of the West Midlands, again chiefly by night attack; and third to disrupt plants and factories during the day by means of fighter-bombers.

Kesselring, commanding Luftflotte 2, was ordered to send 50 sorties per night against London and attack eastern harbours in daylight. Sperrle, commanding Luftflotte 3, was ordered to dispatch 250 sorties per night including 100 against the West Midlands. Seeschlange would be carried out by Fliegerkorps X (10th Air Corps) which concentrated on mining operations against shipping. It also took part in the bombing over Britain. By 19/20 April 1941, it had dropped 3,984 mines, 1⁄3 of the total dropped. The mines' ability to destroy entire streets earned them respect in Britain, but several fell unexploded into British hands allowing counter-measures to be developed which damaged the German anti-shipping campaign.
By mid-November 1940, when the Germans adopted a changed plan, more than 11,600 long tons (11,800 t) of high explosive and nearly 1,000,000 incendiaries had fallen on London. Outside the capital, there had been widespread harassing activity by single aircraft, as well as fairly strong diversionary attacks on Birmingham, Coventry and Liverpool, but no major raids.
